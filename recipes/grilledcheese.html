    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The grilled cheese sandwhich. There's really nothing much to say. It is an american classic that brings me back to when I was a kid. Crispy on the outside combined with the cheesy gooeyness on the inside. This recipe is perfect for both young and old!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bread:</strong> a thicker sliced bread such as texas toast works best</li>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong> use a generous 1/2 Tbsp of butter on each slice of bread. We use unsalted but any butter will work here</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese!:</strong> I use a combination of sliced medium cheddar, gouda and Havarti cheese.</li>        
      </ul>
    
    <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Butter the toast:</strong> spread 1/2 Tbsp butter on one side of each slice of bread</li>
        <li><strong>Heat skillet:</strong> place a skillet over low to medium/low heat. A griddle should be at 275ËšF. Immediately add 2 slices of bread with the butter-side-down</li>
        <li><strong>Add cheese:</strong> tack cheeses on one of the pieces of bread, cover with the other piece of toast and flip the sandwich over</li>
        <li><strong>Brown the toast:</strong> continue sauteeing, flipping once, until both sides are golden brown and cheese is melted</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> cut the sandwich in half on the diagonal to serve</li>
      </ol>
