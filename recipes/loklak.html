      <h3>Description:</h3>
      
      <p>One of the most <em>simple yet delicious</em> recipes you can make at home right now! A dish I hold true to my heart. Well seasoned beef served on top of a variety of vegetables (Typically: Chopped Onions, Tomatoes, Cucumber, and Lettuce). Best served with a simple dipping sauce consisting of four simple ingredients: Lemon Juice, Fish Sauce, Ground Black Pepper, and Water. This dish will certainly make your mouth water. The nature of Lok Lak allow you to switch up indgredients to your liking. Don't like beef? Try it with chicken, pork or any other alternatives! Same with the vegetables!</p>
