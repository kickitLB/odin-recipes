      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Nothing beats the cold like a hot bowl of chili. Chili is a comfort food where I'm from. It is really easy to make thanks to the help of a slow cooker! All you need to do is add the ingredients in one pot and a little bit of time. The longer you wait the better the chili becomes. You'll be having the best chili in your life after a long days work!</p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Olive Oil:</strong> Use for sauteeing. Vegetable oil will work too fi that's what you have on hand.</li>
          <li><strong>Ground beef:</strong> I recommend 85% lean. It has a good ratio of fat for browning but not too much.</li>
          <li><strong>Yellow onion</strong> and <strong>garlic:</strong> aromatics that add lots of flavor. Use fresh garlic for best results.</li>
          <li><strong>Canned tomatoes with green chilies:</strong> if you can't find the size listed then you can use 2 (14.5 oz) cans of tomatoes then add a 1 (4 oz) can of diced green chilies.</li>
          <li><strong>Beef broth:</strong> this thins it out, if you don't want it to get soupy at all then you can omit it. If you want it more soup add a little more.</li>
          <li><strong>Spices: chili powder, cumin, paprika, sugar, coriander, S&amp;P.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Cocoa powder:</strong> this secret ingredient adds depth. Don't worry it's not going to taste like chocolate.</li>
          <li><strong>Dark and light kidney beans:</strong> if you don't have both shades just use two dark.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Saute aromatics, add to slow cooker:</strong> Heat olive oil in a large and deep non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.
            Add onion and saute 3 minutes, then add garlic and saute 30 seconds longer. Pour onions into a 6 or 7 quart slow cooker</li>
          <li><strong>Brown beef:</strong> Return skillet to medium-high eat, add beef and cook stirring occasionally until beef has browned.</li>
          <li><strong>Drain fat, add beef to slow cooker:</strong> Drain most of fat from beef, leaving about 2 Tbsp in with beef (this is optional, I think it ads flavor but you can drain it all if you prefer). Pour browned beef into slow cooker.</li>
          <li><strong> Add liquids and seasonings:</strong> Stir in diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, beef broth, chili powder, cumin, paprika, cocoa powder, sugar, coriander and season mixture with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
          <li><strong>Cook low and slow:</strong> Cover with lid and cook on low heat for 5 to 6 hours.</li>
          <li><strong>Stir in beans:</strong> Add in dark and light red kidney beans and allow to heat through, about 2 minutes.</li>
          <li>Serve warm with desired toppings.</li>
        </ol>
