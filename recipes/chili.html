      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Nothing beats the cold like a hot bowl of chili. Chili is a comfort food where I'm from. It is really easy to make thanks to the help of a slow cooker! All you need to do is add the ingredients in one pot and a little bit of time. The longer you wait the better the chili becomes. You'll be having the best chili in your life after a long days work!</p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Olive Oil:</strong> Use for sauteeing. Vegetable oil will work too fi that's what you have on hand.</li>
          <li><strong>Ground beef:</strong> I recommend 85% lean. It has a good ratio of fat for browning but not too much.</li>
          <li><strong>Yellow onion</strong> and <strong>garlic:</strong> aromatics that add lots of flavor. Use fresh garlic for best results.</li>
          <li><strong>Canned tomatoes with green chilies:</strong> if you can't find the size listed then you can use 2 (14.5 oz) cans of tomatoes then add a 1 (4 oz) can of diced green chilies.</li>
          <li><strong>Beef broth:</strong> this thins it out, if you don't want it to get soupy at all then you can omit it. If you want it more soup add a little more.</li>
          <li><strong>Spices: chili powder, cumin, paprika, sugar, coriander, S&amp;P.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Cocoa powder:</strong> this secret ingredient adds depth. Don't worry it's not going to taste like chocolate.</li>
          <li><strong>Dark and light kidney beans:</strong> if you don't have both shades just use two dark.</li>
        </ul>
