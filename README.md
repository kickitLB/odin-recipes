# odin-recipes
first odin project

This was my first project where I used exclusively HTML. I learned several lessons from this project. 

1. Pay attention to how I format my code. I look back to my loklak and chili page and my formating was off. My grilled cheese code looks alot better to read.

2. Coding even most basic HTML page takes time for me.

3. Always remember to commit as often as possible. During this project I struggled with this. However I finally get the grasp of staging and committing code to github.

4. I learned a few shortcuts on VS code to make more efficient use of my time. notable moving multiple lines of code up, down, left and right.
